2024/08/12, 15:21 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: You sure you wanna know ?
2024/08/12, 15:23 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: This message was deleted
2024/08/12, 15:24 - Aidan: Yea I think so
2024/08/12, 15:24 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Brace yourself
2024/08/12, 15:24 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Lucé was mad at Nolene because Nolene likes Jordan and is also talking to him, however Lucé dated Jordan. Now, a critical piece of information,Nolene is not besties with Lucé but they are on a mutual friendship. Therefore I see nothing wrong with Nolene and Jordan but Lucé feels the need to go out of her way to swear at Nolene and talking about Nolene making it EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to try to resolve the situation. Tammy and Nolene where talking about Nolene telling Lucé about her and Jordan however they were whispering making Lucé feel as if she was the one being spoken about but in a bad manner, with that happening, being the cause of Lucé's actions, Lucé went to Nolene this morning and said : "I know about Jordan." With possibly the most irritated look on her face I've ever seen. Lucé is well know for often picking violence and screaming at people rather than to CALMLY find a solution. Now personal opinion, thee only way in which this would bother her to such and extend is if she still has feelings for Jordan. Little bit of a spoiler tho, Lucé has a boyfriend, namely Ronnie. And it bothers me because Lucé keeps swearing at people  and treating everyone like nothing becishes mad. All of this because she dated someone who's now moved on. 
P.s. she just posted something about her bf so ahgggggg
2024/08/12, 15:25 - Aidan: gimmie 2 sec to read
2024/08/12, 15:25 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Take your time 🙂

2024/08/12, 15:34 - Aidan: Yea I hope so too, but if you say that she is always like this would she even apologize?
2024/08/12, 15:36 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Nope, but Ive got faith, and I hope she sees what's she's done

2024/08/13, 11:38 - Aidan: I hate Theory
2024/08/13, 11:38 - Aidan: Its practical that I like
2024/08/13, 11:38 - Aidan: The actual coding
2024/08/13, 11:38 - Aidan: I don't want to know what a IP adress is made of
2024/08/13, 11:40 - Aidan: The thing is just I am writing exams in 2 months
2024/08/13, 11:40 - Aidan: And I'm stressed abt how I'm gonna get 61 up to 85
2024/08/13, 11:40 - Aidan: Or smt like that
2024/08/13, 11:51 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: May I advise something?
2024/08/13, 11:51 - Aidan: Sure
2024/08/13, 12:02 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: I'm really sorry you don't enjoy it... Maybe changing your mindset and attitude towards it might help, 
Think of it like this...
I HATE studying for natural sciences and I sleep in class and get bored listening to the teacher, however if I don't then I'm likely to fail my tests and won't be allowed to take life sciences which I *need* in order to study psychology. I recently got the fright of my life when I was on the brink of failing natural sciences. 
I ended up forcing myself to study by telling myself I wasn't allowed to use my phone until I knew the work I needed to. My marks aren't as bad as they used to be but they aren't great. My suggestion would be to set up a reward for your, like something you enjoy doing and tell yourself that unless you've prepared for the next theory test you don't get the reward.... Oh and setting things up like dates on which your going to study what and for how long your going to study that specific thing 🫠
2024/08/13, 12:05 - Aidan: Thank you for sharing. I don't hate the whole subject It's more the theory. I feel like I do all the work and study what I'm told to but I'm just not getting the marks. I think I just need to go through my old papers and see what I get wrong and use that knowledge in my paper this week. Thanks again 🫶🏻🫠
2024/08/13, 12:09 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Anytime ig 🫠🎀
2024/08/13, 12:09 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Anyway... What you up too
2024/08/13, 12:09 - Aidan: I spoke with my mom about it and she said its fine. I'm writing in 2 months so I still have quite some time. I started english exactly like this and now I'm getting quite high marks. So she said she will help with the studying
2024/08/13, 12:09 - Aidan: About to exercise. U?

Let's say theoretically, I invited you to youth. And you saw the way I worshiped 😝( which I must say I look pretty crazy but I love it). Would you joint me in my craziness or would you stand at the back Where their are a lot more isolated worshippers?🥸
2024/08/24, 08:48 - Aidan: Well... for me I'd probably say maybe not the first time I would go, but as I get to know the people and get confortable I would join you. Like at this one homeschooling camp I started off quiet like most boys but ended off jumping up and down and dancing. So yea hope that answers your wuestion.

2024/08/27, 17:57 - Aidan: Ooooh I see yea thats not good.

2024/08/27, 17:58 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Wdum?
2024/08/27, 18:00 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Just for reference... I don't like him back. And he asked me out and I felt bad for saying no but I HAD to I have different _priorities/ standers_ if that's  the right word. So I then had to spend my whole break around the guy I just rejected because my friend thought I said yes,
2024/08/27, 18:01 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: And only realised what actually happened when it was too late
2024/08/27, 18:05 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: On the plus side I just got home and we have a new baby sheep ( another one ) but they have strange markings

2024/08/27, 22:46 - Aidan: I wanna continue the questions if I may 🫠

What is a quality that you admire in people?
2024/08/28, 06:40 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Morning cupcake 🤍
How did you sleep
2024/08/28, 06:41 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Oh... Well then I hope you have fantastic day regardless of what you're doing
2024/08/28, 06:48 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Oh ofc 

Physically: 👀 eyes and height ( yours specifically ) 
Idk what the other one is : being social but knowing when to just enjoy the silence and company of another person. Being thoughtful and mindful of what's going on around you. Not having an awkward energy ( if that's the right words to use) and lastly KNOWING THAT MY SPELLING ERRORS ARE NOT ALWAYS IN TENSIONAL AND I DO ACTUALLY HAVE AN ISSUES THAT MY PARENTS DON'T WANT TO GET CHECKED OUT And being okey with it
2024/08/28, 07:00 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: What about you?
2024/08/28, 07:59 - Aidan: Ooo another onee 👀
Morning jelly bean 🤍
I did thanks and you?
2024/08/28, 07:59 - Aidan: Awww thank you I hope you must too 😌🥹
2024/08/28, 08:01 - Aidan: Awww thats so sweet 🥹🤍
Oo yea social is nice but silence is also good
Wdym awkward energy?
🤣 yeaaaa I gett it (I also make errrors oftern 🥹)
2024/08/28, 08:04 - Aidan: Well personally

Physically: Being shorter than me (it's nothing like I just want to be bigger and stronger...) and well being huggable
Other: Being emotionally strong but also being open to sharing with me and not just raking it all and keeping it bottled up. Being kind is big for me. 🥹
2024/08/28, 08:22 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: I think I like cupcake🥸
I did... You have any weird dreams ?
2024/08/28, 08:23 - Aidan: I like it too 😄
Not any weird dreams and you? 👀
2024/08/28, 08:25 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: For example one of my friends doesn't hug people because she doesn't know if she's supposed to hug with her arms at top or bottom so she just doesn't hug people. But then it's weird because you got infor a hug and she either keeps her arms next to her or she stops you and asks to great you in any other way 
Which don't get me wrong I respect it but if we were already good friends it would have been EXTREMELY awkward
2024/08/28, 08:25 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: I did actually
2024/08/28, 08:26 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: I was sorta just sitting at the top of a mountain that was cover in grass and just talking to a kid I did recognise
2024/08/28, 08:27 - Aidan: Ooo ok I see yea. Isn't it normally below the shoulders if you don't like them but under if you like them (romantically I mean)?
2024/08/28, 08:27 - Aidan: Oh?
2024/08/28, 08:28 - Aidan: Oooo
2024/08/28, 08:28 - Aidan: May I ask who it was?
2024/08/28, 08:28 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Ohhh I get it...
2024/08/28, 08:29 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Not necessarily... I mean all my friends I hug then under the shoulders ( not low obv)
2024/08/28, 08:30 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Idk... He was young tho like may 7 or 8
2024/08/28, 08:31 - Aidan: Wait my bad I spoke wrong
2024/08/28, 08:31 - Aidan: Correction:
2024/08/28, 08:31 - Aidan: Isn't it normally below the shoulders if you don't like them but above if you like them (romantically I mean)?
2024/08/28, 08:31 - Aidan: There
2024/08/28, 08:31 - Aidan: I said bellow and under 🤣
2024/08/28, 08:34 - Aidan: I see
2024/08/28, 08:36 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: No. yes but no.
Lemme put it to you like this... Girls like it when hug under shoulders I won't explain why... All I can say is it has the same reason for why girls call it a " *waist* _hug_ "
But that the same time if you, for example, are 6"3 ( definitely not pointing out anyone in particular) and to significant other in 5"4 then the standard would be to hug on top
2024/08/28, 08:38 - Aidan: Ooh ok yea that makes sense... Well then its a shame this random person can't hug under the shoulders 😔🤣
2024/08/28, 08:54 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Hold nothing says they can't it's just a matter of it would be weird if you had to bend down to hug someone
2024/08/28, 08:54 - Aidan: Yeaa Ik but also ik some ppl don't like that
2024/08/28, 08:54 - Aidan: Do you?
2024/08/28, 08:58 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Depends on the person who's hugging me
2024/08/28, 08:58 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Awww... You're so cute 🤍🙈
2024/08/28, 08:59 - Aidan: How abt me 😝

2024/08/28, 09:00 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Baby steps 🫠

2024/08/28, 09:06 - Aidan: So by baby steps wym?
2024/08/28, 09:09 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: I don't normally let people hug me under my shoulders because it just bothers me unless ofc I'm comfortable with the person

2024/08/29, 17:34 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Well you know about this morning Sooo... When I got to school this morning I found out Lucé cut herself again because there were issues with her and her bf ( obv I got frustrated because they couldn't just talk things out? 😕) 
But anyway... I didn't let it bug me because I was writing geography and I wasn't ganna let it mess with my head ( I did go check up on her after the test tho) then I wrote and it was sorta okey... I can't really guess what I got tho...  I then went to business studies... Got a lecture because half the class didn't do their homework... Then substitution and blah blah blah... My day sorta went like normal and then last period I was at physics and the teacher kept us in for 20 mins because we took to long to get to class ( even though we were on the other side of the school... Just sayin') and yeah went to my brother, did homework and then came home
2024/08/29, 18:14 - Aidan: I'm done
2024/08/29, 18:14 - Aidan: Alr gimme 2 sec <This message was edited>

2024/08/29, 18:21 - Aidan: Ty 🤍
2024/08/29, 18:51 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Yeah... But I'm rather sceptical about it because anytime someone recommends help she doesn't want to take it and says she's fine and says that she doesn't need it...test was meh... I take normal geography... I just don't know about this test not in a bad way but not in a good way...
I don't mind tho... I understand why she was upset

2024/08/31, 19:58 - Aidan: Ok but first
2024/08/31, 20:01 - Aidan: I just wanted to explain why Esther was asking so many questions.

I asked her to ask you if you liked me that day that she asked you at church... I was too scared to ask you myself 🙈
When she asked if we are together that was her, but when she asked if you wanted to be that was me asking her to ask you...

Just wanted to get it off of my chest...
2024/08/31, 20:04 - Aidan: But also i agree taking it slow is a good idea <This message was edited>
2024/08/31, 20:29 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: A whole lot of her asking me asking and upsideness... I don't mind answering questions at all but if I am being honest I don't really like the idea of having a messenger or a PI... I don't want you to ever feel afraid to ask me something... I promise I would never judge any questions and I am likely to alwayss answer them 

And thank you 
I'm glad that you told me,
2024/08/31, 20:29 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Thank you
2024/08/31, 20:34 - Aidan: Thank you. I'm sorry i didn't know... Ik it's no excuse but i liked you and without it being weird wanted to know if you did too. From now on I'll ask you directly <This message was edited>

2024/09/08, 21:54 - Aidan: Hey so ik you are asleep, but I just wanted to tell you something...

Idk if you have someone that you talk to about these things or not (?), and if you don't (which i think is the answer) i am sorry that you have to go through these things alone... Ik there is only so much i can do through text and calls, but if you ever need to talk I'll listen. You really do mean alot to me and I want to see you happy. Ik it may take long, but I'll be here, waiting for you to feel ready enough to talk. And hay, if you don't feel comfortable enough, i completely understand that too. Privacy is important to some people. But anyways Imma sleep now.

Bye my jelly bean 🫶🏻🤍🥺

2024/09/15, 17:44 - Aidan: Its ok
2024/09/15, 17:46 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: When we were in Moz 
I didn't have signal... I couldn't really talk to anyone... I know I had drama going on at home but I'd completely forgotten about it... I almost felt stress less... But as soon as we got back anxiety hit me like a 9/11 attack
2024/09/15, 17:47 - Aidan: Oo i see...
2024/09/15, 17:47 - Aidan: I don't rly know what to say...

2024/09/15, 17:51 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Thank you...
2024/09/15, 17:55 - Aidan: Wait but quick question... Why will switching off your phone help?

2024/09/15, 18:22 - Aidan: Sorry. I mean you told me you are stressed (which i completely understand) but i am just curious about how switching of your phone will help?
2024/09/15, 18:24 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: I'm not sure how to explain it...
2024/09/15, 18:27 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Minimizing phone use can reduce the constant influx of information and notifications, which can trigger the stress response.👍
2024/09/15, 18:28 - Aidan: Ooh ok makes sense
2024/09/15, 18:29 - Aidan: Alright well... Let me know what you decide 🙏
2024/09/15, 18:29 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Yup...
2024/09/15, 18:30 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: So I spoke to my mom about it and she said it's not a bad idea so I'm not sure when I'm ganna start it tho
2024/09/15, 18:35 - Aidan: Oh ok so you are going to do it?
2024/09/15, 18:36 - Aidan: Ok well could we maybe still organise that we call once a week? Maybe on zoom or teams or discord or smt like that?
2024/09/15, 18:38 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: null
2024/09/15, 18:39 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: I'll see what I can do but I doubt they'll be long calls...
2024/09/15, 18:42 - Aidan: Oh ok sure I'll do that for you 🤍

2024/09/16, 07:41 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Okey... I spoke to my mom and she said if I don't want to then what I can do is just have my phone off while I'm at school and back on for a certain period of time and then turn it off again... Which is likely what I'll do
2024/09/16, 07:41 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Correction

The whole being treated well and nicely... It scares me because I'm worried that one day it all just goes because I mess something up.
2024/09/16, 19:06 - Aidan: I see... I also don't want to lose you. Is there anything I can do to help maybe give you peace of mind?

2024/09/21, 16:46 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Thank you my cupcake ☺️
2024/09/21, 16:50 - Aidan: np 🤍
why are you asking?
2024/09/21, 16:52 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Im just thinking... Like my friends who know and even my mom is using the term boyfriend and never know if it's boy    friend or boyfriend so I sorta freak out internally because I don't want someone to say something and then your uncomfortable or don't like it
2024/09/21, 16:54 - Aidan: Ooo i get it...
No don't worry 🙃 I could never be uncomfortable with being called your boyfriend 🙈☺️

Ok now I got a question for you... Same as what you asked here (what i reply to)
2024/09/21, 17:00 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Honestly I'd love to 🙈
But Don't wanna do things "so fast" if it freaks you out... Number one priority is to make sure you are happy, okey, comfortable, and it's fine with your mom and dad

Enjoy your sleepover ☺️
2024/09/22, 21:47 - Aidan: Oo ok makes sense
2024/09/22, 21:48 - Aidan: Just cause my parents are decently strict on age ratings... the only R rated movie we ever watched was not on purpose (accidentally watched the extended cut) and wr don't even watch pg 16 novies/shows... the only pg 16 thing I've watched was on my own and kinda in secret but not rly (my mom knows)
2024/09/22, 21:51 - Aidan: Ughh i can't sleep rn... I'm too energetic 😭

2024/09/23, 08:08 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Ohhhh... Most of the stuff I watch is with my parents so they know and honestly speaking if I did watch something that has a 16/18/R rating I don't think my parents would realise( their too focused on the shop/ work/ [themselves] to notice)
2024/09/23, 08:08 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Good morning my cupcake 🤍🤍🤍

Did you rly think I had a gf? 👀
Or was it all a rouse 😗
2024/09/23, 11:32 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Personal in the beginning I thought you a Esther... And then no.... Because she gave me your number. And then found a loop hole to try and gather a nugget of information
2024/09/23, 11:33 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: That seemed rather important because I don't want to be talking to people's partners but was also to shy to ask directly
2024/09/23, 11:34 - Aidan: Oo wait you thought Esther and I? 👀
2024/09/23, 11:34 - Aidan: A loop hole lol

2024/09/23, 11:40 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: OKEY. I'm an overthinker and You're not denying it. Should I fear for the sake of my really appreciated teenage Romance.
2024/09/23, 11:53 - Aidan: You don't have to be sorry... remember my was of finding things out...
2024/09/23, 11:53 - Aidan: Hold up wdym?

2024/09/23, 11:54 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Nvm
2024/09/23, 11:55 - Aidan: Wait i meant asking Esther to ask you...
Did you not like the quizes? Did you not want to do them?
2024/09/23, 11:56 - Aidan: No hang on can we talk about this please?
2024/09/23, 11:57 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Oh I forgot about that... But we figured that out and spoke about it...

2024/09/28, 17:49 - Aidan: Soooo...
2024/09/28, 17:49 - Aidan: Wanna tell me?
2024/09/28, 17:49 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: So my sister was getting a glass from the cupboard after Lea had said that was the right place to get it and : 
Grandmother:  " it's not fine. "  
Alyssa : " it's fine, I've already taken them down " 
Grandmother: " No. It's not fine. " 
So I said " please just say yes  ( I was talking to Alyssa)" 

So my grandmother started swearing and telling us to do whatever we #$@€ want to and that she has brats for grandchildren and that she isn't my mother and on and on and on... So I got up and went to bathroom and sorta just stayed there until she went to the room to fix my sisters school dresses... Then my mother phoned and asked me to go to the shops for her and because I'm legally not allowed to drive on public roads , I ofc had to ask my grandmother to please take me... Instead when I walked into the room the first things she says was " are you here to start fights again" so I said nothing. walked out. Asked my mom to ask my grandmother to take me. Long story short. I went shopping alone while my grandmother waited in the car. P.s. I'm home now 
And this is also one of those things where I won't say anything otherwise I will send up getting into trouble for either bossing People around or Anything at this point
2024/09/28, 17:53 - Aidan: Ooooo i see...

 " what if I say something stupid?" 
" What if I'm loyal but because we're not technically dating does that mean he is too ?" 
" His is hand ' _girlfriend property_ ' ?"  
" Does he ever think ' _oh but we're not technically dating '_" 
" does he get Jealous the same way I do ? " 
" Does he think the same things about me as I think about him?"

2024/10/01, 20:00 - Aidan: Wait
2024/10/01, 20:00 - Aidan: Are you at your dad or father? 👀
2024/10/01, 20:16 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Father
2024/10/01, 20:16 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Because one of my friends and I used to call but ... We fell out
2024/10/01, 20:16 - Aidan: Ooo I'm sorry...
2024/10/01, 20:17 - Aidan: What I'm tryna ask is, how? Did you use data? 👀
2024/10/01, 20:17 - Aidan: May i ask what happened? 🥺
2024/10/01, 20:17 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Oh no he called me on his airtime 💀
2024/10/01, 20:18 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: We got into an agreement because I didn't agree with something he did
2024/10/01, 20:20 - Aidan: Ooo 💀
2024/10/01, 20:21 - Aidan: Ooh... Want to continue or stop there?
2024/10/01, 20:22 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Kinda wanna stop there... But of a harsh subject for me
2024/10/01, 20:22 - Aidan: Oo okey np
2024/10/01, 20:23 - Aidan: I'm sorry 🥺
2024/10/01, 20:25 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Its okey... 🤍
2024/10/01, 20:26 - Aidan: May i ask how old he is? 😗
2024/10/01, 20:27 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: I'm sorry... So he got a girlfriend and she ended up cheating on him, he got mad and started screaming and yelling at everyone for every small thing and became very short tempered... I tried to reason with him and asked him to keep in mind that we didn't do anything to him and don't deserve To be treated as if we did... And he got upset and told me I was dumb and needed to grow up and realised that not everything was about me so I suggest that we no longer be friends...
2024/10/01, 20:27 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: 16 but in grd 9
2024/10/01, 20:29 - Aidan: Ooo okey makes sense...
Just curious but why did you decide do share now? 👀
2024/10/01, 20:29 - Aidan: Oo
2024/10/01, 20:30 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Because I felt bad for not saying anything and I didn't want it to seem as if I was keeping secrets
2024/10/01, 20:34 - Aidan: Ooo heyy no it's rly alright, I get there are some sensitive topics that you wouldn't like to share yet. There is no need to feel bad love 🤍
2024/10/01, 20:40 - Aidan: I didn't realise cheating is such a problem in teenage relationships...

Were you guys good friends? Like longtime friends?
2024/10/01, 20:40 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Thank you .... But now you know
2024/10/01, 20:41 - Aidan: Thanks for telling me though 🤍
2024/10/01, 20:42 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Yup... happened alot more than you think actually... but it also depends on what you consider cheating 

He was my first friend in high school so for about a year
2024/10/01, 20:42 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Sure 🙂
2024/10/01, 20:45 - Aidan: Ooo... what do you consider cheating here?

Oo dangg that's rough... If at any point you'd like to stop talking about this lmk 😗🤍
2024/10/01, 20:48 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: He though that her having a close male friend was a problem and he didn't like that he hugged her so he accused her of cheating
2024/10/01, 20:49 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: I don't mind...
2024/10/01, 20:53 - Aidan: Dang...
2024/10/01, 20:54 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: 🤷‍♀️ he has his own opinion
2024/10/01, 21:04 - Aidan: You don't consider it cheating right?
2024/10/01, 21:04 - Aidan: What would _you_ consider cheating?
2024/10/01, 21:04 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: No... Not at all
2024/10/01, 21:05 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Didn't we have this conversation already
2024/10/01, 21:05 - Aidan: Did we?
2024/10/01, 21:05 - Aidan: Okey
2024/10/01, 21:06 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Watching f.r.i.e.n.d.s with me, not sending me your thoughts on what's going on in sweet tooth , forgetting to tell me about a tennis game or tournament, not telling me why your upset and forgetting who gave you bean
2024/10/01, 21:06 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: .
2024/10/01, 21:06 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: We did
2024/10/01, 21:07 - Aidan: Oo okey makes sense, so basically forgetting about you?
2024/10/01, 21:07 - Aidan: Oo
2024/10/01, 21:08 - Aidan: I see
2024/10/01, 21:08 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Very much so yes
2024/10/01, 21:08 - Aidan: That makes sense...
2024/10/01, 21:08 - Aidan: Why watching f.r.i.e.d.s with you thou?
2024/10/01, 21:09 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: BECAUSE...
2024/10/01, 21:09 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Idk actually know but yeah
2024/10/01, 21:10 - Aidan: Hmm...
2024/10/01, 21:10 - Aidan: So i _shouldn't_ watch f.r.i.e.d.s with you then... Noted 😗
2024/10/01, 21:18 - Aidan: Yea for me it would be like talking to someone else and saying "oh it's nothing don't worry" but you clearly like them and spend lots of time talking to them 🤷‍♂

And obv stuff like being overly affectionate with them...
2024/10/01, 21:18 - Aidan: Idk thou
2024/10/01, 21:18 - Aidan: I don't have experience so i can't rly say much...
2024/10/01, 21:21 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: 💀 excuse me
2024/10/01, 21:22 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Luckily for you the only people you have to worry about are the ones in my books
2024/10/01, 21:22 - Aidan: Well you said you consider it cheating 😭😭
2024/10/01, 21:22 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Well if it counts for anything, I think you're doing a good job 🤍🤭
2024/10/01, 21:22 - Aidan: 💀

2024/10/01, 21:23 - Aidan: Aww 🙈🙈🤍

2024/10/02, 11:26 - Aidan: Oo okey np
2024/10/02, 11:39 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Okey... HI 
How was it
2024/10/02, 11:39 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Nope
2024/10/02, 11:39 - Aidan: Heyy
Twas good thanks... I'll elaborate in a bit i gtg shower
2024/10/02, 11:39 - Aidan: Oo...
2024/10/02, 11:40 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Okie dokie enjoy
2024/10/02, 11:58 - Aidan: Tyty I am done
2024/10/02, 11:59 - Aidan: So it was alright...
The one guy was just is a horid mood, so he made others in bad moods too so the whole mood was just meh...
Otherwise I played well though 😁
2024/10/02, 12:11 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: You're back!
2024/10/02, 12:11 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Ohhh... I see
2024/10/02, 12:12 - Aidan: Yeaa I'm back 🤍
2024/10/02, 12:12 - Aidan: yup
2024/10/02, 12:12 - Aidan: the guy has been in a bad mood this whole week for some reason
2024/10/02, 12:12 - Aidan: he is normally good thou
2024/10/02, 12:15 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: That's unfortunate... Maybe he's not aware of the effect it has on the people around home or maybe something really bad has happened in the background
2024/10/02, 12:18 - Aidan: Yea so the theory that I have gathered from chatter with him is that:
He achieved all of his tennis goals, now he kinda feels lost and when something goes a bit wrong it has a large effect on him...
2024/10/02, 12:28 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: The sense of feeling lost could come from everywhere : sports, family , friends even school... However in the case of goals you could be right he could have been so highly focused on achieving something that the adrenal brought him joy the hyper fication and having the flow of something and then the rug ripped out from underneath your feet can be comfortable and unsettling so maybe he's still trying to find in flaws and where to improve but not being able to find something you're looking for can be EXTREMELY Frustrating 
So give him some time and I'm sure he'll be back to normal
2024/10/02, 12:29 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Also keep in mind that the same thing can affect many people differently for some something small and to others a life changing event
2024/10/02, 12:29 - Aidan: Ooo yea that makes sense...
2024/10/02, 12:29 - Aidan: You are so wise yk 🫠
2024/10/02, 12:30 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Thank you , but 
? Where is coming from?
2024/10/02, 12:31 - Aidan: just a compliment...
Cause like, you are being wise so... idk
2024/10/02, 12:31 - Aidan: so about a year ago he was not great, always mad, but he got out of it and now he is normally happy; other than this week.
2024/10/02, 12:32 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Thank you.. 
I'm not trying to... I'm just saying things I wish someone told me
2024/10/02, 12:32 - Aidan: ooo… okey
2024/10/02, 12:32 - Aidan: but hay, he has people that are helping
2024/10/02, 12:37 - Aidan: SPEAKING OF PEOPLE GOING THROUGH STUFF...

I need some help/advice
2024/10/02, 12:38 - Aidan: my friend (Rain (16) ) went through a breakup and he's not taking it too well
2024/10/02, 12:39 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/02, 12:39 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/02, 12:39 - Aidan: and I wanna help him somehow
2024/10/02, 12:39 - Aidan: also his tennis coach said at the tournament he played he seemed almost in tears when they spoke
also his lessons may be at _her_ house...
2024/10/02, 12:40 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Okeyyy
2024/10/02, 12:41 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: I am sorta half responseing rn because I am in maths
2024/10/02, 12:41 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: So 2 mins please
2024/10/02, 12:41 - Aidan: okok npnp
2024/10/02, 12:58 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Ouch... 
There isn't much you can do other than be there for him when he needs you, 

Healing takes time and it isn't always easy for someone to restart something like that after having formed such a close connection, IM NOT SUGGESTING HE GOES HEAD FIRST IN A NEW RELATIONSHIP. !!!!

but taking time to focus on himself and setting new goals and trying new things, having new experiences and just trying to figure out what's really going on upstairs... And  TALKING, goodness I can't begin to explain to you how important it is to say things out loud and to communicate... Because keeping it inside will only make it worse
2024/10/02, 12:59 - Aidan: <Media omitted>
2024/10/02, 13:00 - Aidan: But i'm thinking of playing some games with him and seeing if it comes out naturally...
2024/10/02, 13:03 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Also, love never fails, 🤷‍♀️
2024/10/02, 13:03 - Aidan: Wdym? 👀
2024/10/02, 13:05 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Give him some time 
He doesn't HAVE to talk about, he still needs to feel comfortable, and he probably has 100 people asking 🤷‍♀️
2024/10/02, 13:06 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Maybe...
2024/10/02, 13:06 - Aidan: yea true true
2024/10/02, 13:06 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: To what we
2024/10/02, 13:07 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: To what? ****
2024/10/02, 13:07 - Aidan: but I think it would be good if he does
2024/10/02, 13:07 - Aidan: To this
2024/10/02, 13:07 - Aidan: .
2024/10/02, 13:08 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: If it fails it wasn't love ( it's not ment to be then, its ganna hurt but you gotta trust the process)
2024/10/02, 13:08 - Aidan: cause like... He really did like her and it wasn't a great ending (they took a break for a month and got back and was just off (but he thought everything was good) then she said it's best to be friends)
2024/10/02, 13:09 - Aidan: Ooo ok makes sense
2024/10/02, 13:09 - Aidan: Like the saying:

If you love something, let it go. If it comes back it is yours. If it doesn't, it never was.

?
2024/10/02, 13:10 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: You see, in some cases the feelings aren't always the same and she might of felt like she was uncomfortable or not supposed to be in a relationship with someone she doesn't actually have feeling for
2024/10/02, 13:10 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Yeah
2024/10/02, 13:11 - Aidan: yea maybe...
The feelings weren't mutual maybe.
But the thing is, he doesn't need to hear that. It will only make him hurt more...
2024/10/02, 13:12 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: OBVIOUSLY NO ONES TO HEAR :" ThE fEelInGs iN yOuR rElAtIonShIp oNLy wEnT oNe wAY"

And to top that 
Today I was supposed to take photos for the soapbox day but my card didn't format AND Alan shouted at me this morning
2024/10/04, 07:43 - Aidan: Aw dang 😭
Why did he shout? 🥺
2024/10/04, 07:54 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Because I was running late and we needed to take the print and when he gave me the printer in the car it got caught between my chest and the seat infront of me so I couldn't breathe and here was Alan who had closed the door so I had no space to move because Lea was next to me ( keep in mind it's a 1 1/2 cab so we sit on the bench in the back) so I told him I couldn't move or anything and it was EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE and he opened the door shouted at me and the closed it again. So I turned the printed vertically and my mom finally stood up for me and I had to and her the printer. So I did and long story short. The printer scrapped skin, my chest is red. My camera is with my mom and my eyes are stuffy from crying 🤭 because it hurts
2024/10/04, 07:58 - Aidan: 😭😭😭
2024/10/04, 07:58 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: So what a morning 🤍🤍

Their friends but Louis is made at Jayden because Jayden said he was taking a break from girls [regarding dating {Louis didn't see it that way,he thought girls in general}]( so Louis assumed Jayden would now be spending every second with him) but now Just because Jayden has female friends apparently he's not allowed to talk to any of us other wise he's going against his word

2024/10/11, 07:19 - Aidan: Yeaaa
2024/10/11, 07:20 - Aidan: Well... Depends on if i can leave when I'm done 😭💀
2024/10/11, 07:26 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: I don't think you'll be allowed to, I think you might have to wait till the end
2024/10/11, 07:27 - Aidan: Nah depends on the venue
2024/10/11, 07:27 - Aidan: Some allow you to leave
2024/10/11, 07:34 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: That's kinda weird
2024/10/11, 07:36 - Aidan: Why?
2024/10/11, 07:40 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Like being able to leave when you're done in some venues but not others, like do you have different rules for each venue
2024/10/11, 07:43 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Can I ask you something?
2024/10/11, 07:43 - Aidan: No so basically:
If you are in a hall with 200 kids and 20 want to leave, it's disruptive. If you are in a group of 20 and 1 wants to leave, it's better...
2024/10/11, 07:43 - Aidan: Sure
2024/10/11, 07:44 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Ohhhhh.... Okey I get it so it's based off of the number of people writing
2024/10/11, 07:44 - Aidan: Basically...
2024/10/11, 07:50 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: If you're in a group of friends that you stand with every morning and one of them ask you :" can jy asb loop, ons wil praat dis teesin ons Klas" but I'm the only person who was asked to "walk", am I in the wrong for being upset
2024/10/11, 07:51 - Aidan: Yoh no not at all... I wanted to say you sound a bit off...

2024/10/12, 22:57 - Aidan: Doesn't rly matter why? <This message was edited>
2024/10/12, 22:57 - Aidan: Okeyy
2024/10/12, 22:57 - Aidan: Questions?
2024/10/12, 22:57 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Because we both have to get up more or less early tomorrow
2024/10/12, 22:57 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Yeah, you first tho
2024/10/12, 22:57 - Aidan: Fiar
2024/10/12, 22:57 - Aidan: Fair
2024/10/12, 22:58 - Aidan: Okey... You alr? Just curious. Sound a lil bit off... idk prob just overthinking but still wanna ask
2024/10/12, 22:58 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: The spelling is giving you a hard time ,hey?
2024/10/12, 22:59 - Aidan: Yea 😭
2024/10/12, 22:59 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: I'm good, just a little bummed because my parents aren't coming to church tomorrow so it's just me and my sisters... I'm not used to going without them but it is what it is I guess...
2024/10/12, 23:00 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: And you, you alright? <This message was edited>

2024/10/12, 23:01 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: I'm glad 😊
2024/10/12, 23:03 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: The shop opens at Ten and they wanna be open however church runs from 9-11 and because it's not busy enough to get a manager to supervise yet ( according to my parents ) they are technically the only ones who can operate the place
2024/10/12, 23:03 - Aidan: Oooh ok makes sense
2024/10/12, 23:03 - Aidan: So it's only for now that they don't go? <This message was edited>
2024/10/12, 23:05 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Yeah... Just for a little while or at least that's what they promised.... And I know in situations like this I'm supposed to trust them and have faith in them but things have a tendency to be changed regardless of what has been said in the past 🤷‍♀️
2024/10/12, 23:05 - Aidan: Hmm yea fair... Sorry i don't rly know what to say 🥺
2024/10/12, 23:06 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: You don't really have to say anything, you're already reading my texts and technically (in a way) listening, which is more than I could ask for I really appreciate it 🤍🤍

2024/10/12, 23:16 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Debatable
2024/10/12, 23:16 - Aidan: Fair
2024/10/12, 23:16 - Aidan: Why so?
2024/10/12, 23:16 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: AHHHHGGGG
You're making me blush🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
2024/10/12, 23:17 - Aidan: Ok depends what camp csuse like in forrest. Idk
If its like Maranaman (where i go) then anythjng
2024/10/12, 23:17 - Aidan: But it's true ☺️🤍🙈🙈🤍
2024/10/12, 23:18 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Every now and then my family likes to go to this place where we stay in cabins and don't get me wrong is great but I'd like to be able to keep in contact with those who aren't with me ( mainly my absolutely amazing boyfriend and best friend) but I can't really do that FROM THE MIDDLE OF NO WHERE
2024/10/12, 23:19 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Too many n's and 2 M's had my mind going 😵‍💫
2024/10/12, 23:19 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: <Media omitted>
2024/10/12, 23:19 - Aidan: Oooh fair 
🙈🙈🙈🙈🤍🤍
But also what if I'm there 🥺
Quick. Who is ur bsf?
2024/10/12, 23:19 - Aidan: 😭🤣🤣💀
2024/10/12, 23:19 - Aidan: Yeaaa
2024/10/12, 23:20 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Xanika 🤭🤍🙈
2024/10/12, 23:21 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: But honestly most wack thing was beach camping 🥲 my goodness there is just sand EVERYWHERE...🥴
2024/10/12, 23:21 - Aidan: Ooo yes ofc 😅
2024/10/12, 23:21 - Aidan: Ughhh i can imagine 😭
2024/10/12, 23:22 - Aidan: null
2024/10/12, 23:22 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: But truth be told, I haven't really got, yk a _BEST FRIEND_, I mean sure I form good connections but most of the time it's not strong enough to actually be considered a best friend relationship
2024/10/12, 23:22 - Aidan: Ooo fsir
2024/10/12, 23:22 - Aidan: Fair
2024/10/12, 23:22 - Aidan: Not Xanica?
2024/10/12, 23:23 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Yes... And bite the bottom
2024/10/12, 23:23 - Aidan: Yessss
2024/10/12, 23:23 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Xanika*
2024/10/12, 23:23 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: But it also makes alittle game because once you bite the bottom it doesn't really stand properly so now you have to try and make it balance
2024/10/12, 23:24 - Aidan: Sorry 😭😭
2024/10/12, 23:24 - Aidan: Hehehehe truwe
2024/10/12, 23:24 - Aidan: Ek

2024/10/12, 23:24 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: Not really honestly, I don't really talk to her that much and we only ever really CONNECT when we're in person but then we're basically criminal masterminds ready to take over he world
2024/10/12, 23:25 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: What makes you think that
2024/10/12, 23:25 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: You

2024/10/12, 23:31 - Aidan: 😭😭😭
Fair enough
2024/10/12, 23:31 - Astrid Bean 🔒🤍: YEESSS... But then you have them one at a time and then the last one feels funny or theirs and odd number
