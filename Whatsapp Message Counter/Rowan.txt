2024/06/05, 22:19 - Aidan: 4k is alot 😭😭
2024/06/05, 22:20 - Aidan: Who is hat mouse 😭😭
2024/06/05, 22:25 - Rowan: 💀 💀 I usually only get coops in summer
2024/06/05, 22:25 - Rowan: A funny little furry that lives south of rasmodius, he sells hats
2024/06/05, 22:30 - Aidan: Y
2024/06/05, 22:30 - Aidan: Also is there a better way to make money?
2024/06/05, 22:31 - Rowan: Because they dont really get you any money until you develop them
2024/06/05, 22:31 - Rowan: At least from my experience
2024/06/05, 22:31 - Rowan: Fishing, crops and extra gems were my main sources of money
2024/06/05, 22:32 - Rowan: Idk if you're alr past the egg festival but what I usually do is save up all my money until the festival comes and plant strawberries
2024/06/05, 22:32 - Rowan: Those are my first spring cash crop
2024/06/05, 22:32 - Rowan: They're really valuable so they're good money ;u;
2024/06/05, 22:34 - Aidan: Yes we are
2024/06/05, 22:39 - Rowan: Ah i see, alr
2024/06/05, 22:39 - Rowan: Then kale or cauliflowers will probably get you the most money
2024/06/05, 22:39 - Rowan: Well actually I think kale's for xp but it's still the most lucrative option
2024/06/05, 22:40 - Rowan: Potatoes are p good too
2024/06/05, 22:40 - Rowan: But anyways, it doesn't really matter in the end if you're chilling, these are just speed strategies 💀
2024/06/05, 22:40 - Rowan: Do what the vibe wants
2024/06/05, 22:40 - Rowan: But anyways, my eyelids are shutting, ima go sleep
2024/06/05, 22:41 - Rowan: Good nighty

2024/07/03, 13:42 - Aidan: yk what I mean 😭
2024/07/03, 13:42 - Rowan: i didn't actually, that was a wild acronym for assignment <This message was edited>
2024/07/03, 13:42 - Rowan: 💀💀
2024/07/03, 13:42 - Aidan: ikik
2024/07/03, 13:42 - Aidan: but like
2024/07/03, 13:42 - Aidan: some code uses it as a acronym'
2024/07/03, 13:42 - Aidan: lol
2024/07/03, 13:43 - Aidan: like in .ass
2024/07/03, 13:43 - Aidan: lol
2024/07/03, 13:43 - Rowan: thats crazy
2024/07/03, 13:43 - Rowan: they just did that to be funny, there's no way they couldn't have used "task" instead
2024/07/03, 13:43 - Rowan: 😭
2024/07/03, 13:43 - Rowan: or well, .ass would stand for assign i think
2024/07/03, 13:44 - Aidan: o ye
2024/07/03, 13:44 - Rowan: so a better word would be "allocate" so the acronym could be "allo" or "all" if you wanna be really ambiguous
2024/07/03, 13:44 - Rowan: or task could still work ig, it does work as a verb sometimes <This message was edited>
2024/07/03, 13:45 - Rowan: but anyway, im speaking yapanese frfr
2024/07/03, 13:46 - Aidan: lmao
2024/07/03, 13:46 - Aidan: wyd in eng?
2024/07/03, 13:46 - Rowan: writing a terrible descriptive piece

2024/07/03, 14:02 - Aidan: why
2024/07/03, 14:02 - Aidan: ?
2024/07/03, 14:18 - Rowan: idk these pieces im writing are not eating
2024/07/03, 14:23 - Aidan: lol
2024/07/03, 14:24 - Rowan: its just a result of the assignment ig
2024/07/03, 14:24 - Rowan: when you ask a critter to write 13 desc pieces at once with a vague prompt the quality is bound to be lower
2024/07/03, 14:24 - Rowan: at least, that's what i tell myself 😍🙏
2024/07/04, 16:43 - Rowan: This message was deleted
2024/07/04, 16:43 - Rowan: might be the jankiest code ive ever written
2024/07/04, 16:43 - Rowan: also, good afternoon/evenig
2024/07/04, 16:43 - Rowan: idk, is 4pm evening? I think it is sometimes but its not giving evening today
2024/07/04, 16:43 - Rowan: but anyway
2024/07/04, 16:59 - Rowan: wait omw theres so many problems with what I sent
2024/07/04, 17:00 - Rowan: gib momen, lemme resend the edited version

2024/07/08, 12:14 - Aidan: oe
2024/07/08, 12:15 - Rowan: i was asking you what the subject code for comp science is but i got it so its alr 😭
2024/07/08, 12:19 - Aidan: wait wat :D
2024/07/08, 12:19 - Aidan: what subject code?
2024/07/08, 12:19 - Rowan: Cambridge assigns all their subjects subject codes and you need to know them for exam shenanigans
2024/07/08, 12:19 - Rowan: I haven't learnt them this year yet so im just getting that done
2024/07/08, 12:20 - Aidan: what are codes?
2024/07/08, 12:20 - Rowan: for the subjects im doing:
physics - 0625
cs - 0478
AS English - 9093
AS Afrikaans - 8679
2024/07/08, 12:20 - Aidan: ooooh
2024/07/08, 12:20 - Aidan: makes sense
2024/07/08, 12:21 - Rowan: for math its 0581, normal eng 0500 (I think, im not sure), for chem I think it was 0620 and then idek normal afr
2024/07/08, 12:21 - Aidan: what are they used for?
2024/07/08, 12:22 - Rowan: for registering for exams and you need them at the exam venue
2024/07/08, 12:22 - Rowan: subjects have multiple variations so you need your subject code to make sure you're writing the correct variation of said subject
2024/07/08, 12:28 - Aidan: ooh
2024/07/08, 16:03 - Aidan: Yoo

2024/07/22, 15:04 - Rowan: Good evening parents. This is a rough planning in terms of the revision till the exam. The program will obviously be adapted depending the needs of the students.
The students will from this week onward get a weekly revision sheets that will be available on Sunday night so that they can start early the Monday morning. I have tried to break down the week's revision in daily chunks. It is just an indication and each student can adapt it to his needs and time available.  The revision sheet will be uploaded under the Game Plan heading.
2024/07/22, 15:05 - Rowan: Student will also het a theory and an practical paper for homework every week from now on. The papers will be under the Practical and Theory revision. 
The Monday Last Scenario questions recordings will be uploaded in a section dedicated for it.
Students are also encourage to watch the videos under the Programming Toolbelt
There is a lesson on Wednesdays at 11:00 for the core group (that started January) any of the other students are also welcome to attend those lessons. We will do further questions on that day (see planning) however these lessons will be recorded and available under the Online recordings if your child can not make that slot.
Please do not hesitate to contact me should your child experience any problems.

2024/09/05, 14:12 - Rowan: just basically read the rubric lmao, it's actually decently comprehensive
2024/09/05, 14:12 - Rowan: ye and i know why lmao, there were only 4 valid answers given
