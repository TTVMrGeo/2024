2024/09/08, 21:46 - Aidan: YT > TikTok
2024/09/08, 21:46 - Rowan: Fizzers I love, tinkies are mid
2024/09/08, 21:47 - Aidan: Insta for talking not reels
2024/09/08, 21:47 - Rowan: Agreed, there's more brainrot on yt shorts though
2024/09/08, 21:47 - Aidan: YT longform > shorts and reels and tiktok
2024/09/08, 21:47 - Aidan: Yea but not on longform
2024/09/08, 21:47 - Aidan: If you watch long vids you can avoid it
2024/09/08, 21:47 - Aidan: Depending on what you watch
2024/09/08, 21:47 - Rowan: Yeah no insta is another league
2024/09/08, 21:47 - Aidan: Like me
2024/09/08, 21:47 - Aidan: Instagram
2024/09/08, 21:47 - Aidan: I mean
2024/09/08, 21:47 - Aidan: Hitman
2024/09/08, 21:48 - Aidan: And insta comments are unhinged
2024/09/08, 21:48 - Rowan: Yeah duh but tiktok doesn't really support longform, if we're comparing them we have to compare them in a specific niche, and in this case that is short form
2024/09/08, 21:48 - Rowan: Duh
2024/09/08, 21:48 - Rowan: 💀 Ew whyd I use that twice, idk
2024/09/08, 21:48 - Aidan: Buttt my list by fun is
YT > Insta > Pintrest > Sanpchat > tiktok
2024/09/08, 21:49 - Aidan: Wym
2024/09/08, 21:49 - Rowan: I used 'duh' twice
2024/09/08, 21:49 - Aidan: Fair

2024/09/08, 21:49 - Rowan: Chile anyways
2024/09/08, 21:49 - Aidan: By how easy it is to get lost in scrolling is
YT > insta > tiktok ig > snap > pintrest (not at all)
2024/09/08, 21:50 - Rowan: Put insta above yt rn, you are actually addicted to doomscrolling
2024/09/08, 21:53 - Paige: WHAT
